# GitHub Contribution Graph
A minimalist and dynamic GitHub Contribution Graph replica built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases a grid-based graph that changes colors dynamically on each page load, representing user contributions over a year.

## Features
- Contribution Graph Design: A grid layout mimicking the GitHub contribution graph.
- Dynamic Colors: The graph's colors change randomly each time the page is loaded, enhancing visual appeal.
- Responsive Layout: Scales well on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Structures the graph and grid elements.
- CSS: Styles the grid and applies gradient colors for the contribution boxes.
- JavaScript: Implements the dynamic color changes on page load.
